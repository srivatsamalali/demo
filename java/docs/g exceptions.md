:beginner: **Java Exception Handling Keywords**  

Java provides specific keywords for exception handling purposes, we will look after them first and then we will write a simple program showing how to use them for exception handling.

:label: ***_throw_***  
We know that if any exception occurs, an exception object is getting created and then Java runtime starts processing to handle them. Sometime we might want to generate exception explicitly in our code, for example in a user authentication program we should throw exception to client if the password is null. throw keyword is used to throw exception to the runtime to handle it.  

:label: ***throws***    
When we are throwing any exception in a method and not handling it, then we need to use throws keyword in method signature to let caller program know the exceptions that might be thrown by the method. The caller method might handle these exceptions or propagate it to itâ€™s caller method using throws keyword. We can provide multiple exceptions in the throws clause and it can be used with main() method also.

:label: ***try-catch***  
We use try-catch block for exception handling in our code. try is the start of the block and catch is at the end of try block to handle the exceptions. We can have multiple catch blocks with a try and try-catch block can be nested also. catch block requires a parameter that should be of type Exception.

:label: ***finally***  
finally block is optional and can be used only with try-catch block. Since exception halts the process of execution, we might have some resources open that will not get closed, so we can use finally block. finally block gets executed always, whether exception occurred or not.

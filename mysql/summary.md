### Working with joins

1. The INNER JOIN matches each row in one table with every row in other tables and allows you to query rows that contain columns from both tables.

```sql
SELECT
    select_list
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON join_condition1
INNER JOIN t3 ON join_condition2
```

```java
class IfStatement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int number = 10;

        // checks if number is greater than 0
        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        }
        System.out.println("This statement is always executed.");
    }
}
```
